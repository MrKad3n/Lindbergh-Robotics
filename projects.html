					Our outreach program aims to promote STEM education and robotics in the community. We conduct workshops, demonstrations, and mentorship programs for local schools and organizations.
					By inspiring the next generation of engineers and scientists, we hope to foster a love for technology and innovation.
					We have made a working drift car as part of our outreach efforts, showcasing the principles of robotics and engineering in a fun and engaging way.
