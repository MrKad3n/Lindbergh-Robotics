				<h2>Outreach</h2>
				<img src="images/outreach.png" alt="Outreach">
				<div>
					Our outreach program aims to promote STEM education and robotics in the community. We conduct workshops, demonstrations, and mentorship programs for local schools and organizations.
					By inspiring the next generation of engineers and scientists, we hope to foster a love for technology and innovation.
					We have made a working drift car as part of our outreach efforts, showcasing the principles of robotics and engineering in a fun and engaging way.
					Other projects from this list are often used in outreach as well.
					<br>Cost: Varies
					<br>Team members: 25

				<h2>Augmented Reality Cart</h2>
				<img src="images/ar_cart.png" alt="Augmented Reality Cart">
				<div>
					Our Augmented Reality Cart project aims to create an interactive experience for users by integrating augmented reality (AR) technology with a mobile robot platform.
					By using AR, we can overlay digital information onto the physical world, enhancing the way users interact with our robots.
					This project will involve collaboration between software developers, hardware engineers, and designers to create a seamless and engaging user experience.
					<br>Cost: 1,000 USD
					<br>Team members: 5
